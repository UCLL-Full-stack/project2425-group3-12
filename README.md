# Game Club App 
## Description 
This app allows ‘Organizers’ to create game events, cancel game events, and confirm member 
sign-ups to game events for the club they manage.  
‘Members’ can browse all available game clubs, join one or more game club(s), and sign up for 
game events belonging to game club(s) they have joined. 
The app also features user authentication, so only registered users can view pages such as ‘Game 
Clubs’ and ‘Game Events’. Depending on the role assigned to a user they will be able to perform 
previously mentioned actions.
